# fakenewsgraph.de - frontend

This is the frontend of the fakenewsgraph.de webservice.

## Installing / Getting started

- run `git clone https://github.com/ltodt/fake-news-graph-core.git`
- run `cd react-dev`
- run `npm i` or `yarn install`
- run `npm start`

## Developing

### Built With
React / Redux / Less / NodeJS / Express

### Prerequisites
- Node JS / NPM
- PM2 in production mode



### Building

#### Development
##### Styling:

- `grunt less` compiles less files
- `grunt watch` watches the less files and compiles them after every change

##### React and Express App
If you started the server with `npm start` it’s running with webpack dev and hot middleware so changes on react or server files should retranspile the files automatically. You can manually start (restart) the server by running

`npm run start-with-babel-node`

#### Production
To run the app in prodcution mode you need to run

`npm run start-production`

**OR**

##### 1. transpile the app with webpack for production mode by running

`webpack -p`

##### 2. Compile the less files, minificate the stylesheet, give it a hash and override the `<link href="styleseeht.css`> by running

`grunt production`

##### 3. Transpile the server files (including the react app for server side rendering) by running

`npm run build`

##### 4. Start the the server by running

`npm run start-production-server`

This uses PM2 process manager. You can also start the server with node or any other tool, just set the NODE_ENV to production and use the entry point `dist/server/index.js`
